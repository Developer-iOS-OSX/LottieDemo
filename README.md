# A Simple Demo for Lottie

Good UI animations can greatly improve user experience of a mobile app if it is done precisely. It is usually one of the factors that differentiate a great app from a mediocre one. Designing a meaningful and functional animation is hard. The same goes for implementation. In particular, if the animation or view transition is complex, it is a hard task for iOS developers to implement it in the app.

Assuming you are not an indie developer, you are probably working in a team of developers and UI/UX designers. How many times have you come across this situation? Your designer shows you a nice and cool animation, and asks you to incorporate it in the app. You think the animation looks really cool, but it's utterly hard and a lengthy process to implement it. 

Now with Lottie, created by Airbnb, developers can easily render animations without the need of writing lines and lines of code. You can take animations from Adobe After Effects and use them directly in your Xcode project. It is really cool and saves you tons of time from implementing the animations.

In this tutorial, I will show you a few things:

- What is Lottie?
- How do you use it in your iOS projects?
- Build a demo app with Lottie
